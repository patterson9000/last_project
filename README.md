I created a global social media fitness app which allows people to connect with friends, family, and random people all around the world. To have friendly fitness competitions, buy personal trainers, produces and personal fitness programs, provided by fitness influencers and personal trainers. The app will contain free programs, a page that logs your progress. sporting events, video sharing, and the ability to connect with the fitness community with events and competitions from all aspects of fitness. From cardio training, strength training, techniques, and everything in between.Â 

There is a lot of functionality that doesn't work unfortunately, the Bluetooth, events, challenge and edit buttons don't work. the login and registration pages don't work a 100%. you can't submit the comments or send the free programs to the log page, but you can seamlessly flow through the pages without any effort. I used Django, python and sqlite3 for the database. the project has a login page, three registration pages, a sports page to pick your programs, a home page, profile page. and a stats page to log your progress.
